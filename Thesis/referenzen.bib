abstract={In the light of substantial improvements to the quality and availability of virtual reality (VR) hardware seen since 2013, this review seeks to update our knowledge about the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs) in education and training. Following a comprehensive search 21 documents reporting on experimental studies were identified, quality assessed, and analysed. The quality assessment shows that the study quality was below average according to the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, especially for the studies that were designed as user evaluations of educational VR products. The review identified a number of situations where HMDs are useful for skills acquisition. These include cognitive skills related to remembering and understanding spatial and visual information and knowledge; psychomotor skills related to head-movement, such as visual scanning or observational skills; and affective skills related to controlling your emotional response to stressful or difficult situations. Outside of these situations the HMDs had no advantage when compared to less immersive technologies or traditional instruction and in some cases even proved counterproductive because of widespread cybersickness, technological challenges, or because the immersive experience distracted from the learning task.},

We present the Personal Cockpit, a solution for mobile multitasking on head-worn displays. We appropriate empty space around the user to situate virtual windows for use with direct input. Through a design-space exploration, we run a series of user studies to fine-tune our layout of the Personal Cockpit. In our final evaluation, we compare our design against two baseline interfaces for switching between everyday mobile applications. This comparison highlights the deficiencies of current view-fixed displays, as the Personal Cockpit provides a 40{\%} improvement in application switching time. We demonstrate of several useful implementations and a discussion of important problems for future implementation of our design on current and near-future wearable devices.},

@article{alkemade,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC. In the early stages of 3D design, sketches are used to quickly conceptualize ideas and gain insight into problems and possible solutions. Computer-aided design tools are widely used for 3D modeling and design, but their required precision and 2D mouse and screen-based interface inhibit the flow of ideas. A study was conducted to explore the efficiency of hand tracking and virtual reality (VR) for 3D object manipulations in conceptual design. Based on existing research on conceptual design and hand gestures, an intuitive hand-based interaction model is proposed. An experiment on basic 3D manipulation shows that participants using a simple VR and hand-tracking interface prototype have similar performance to those using a traditional mouse and screen interface. For the improvement of gestural conceptual design interfaces, the relevant issues are identified.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify and compare user experience issues and provide recommendations for the three airline websites. The websites were evaluated through heuristic evaluation and usability testing methods. Based on the heuristic evaluation findings, two relatively difficult task scenarios were generated for usability testing: A total of 168 student users participated in the study. The participants' performances for user testing were evaluated in terms of task completion time, success rate, and number of page views by a remote usability testing tool, Loop11. Additionally, a post-test questionnaire was administered online. Statistical analysis results indicated a significant 'website-design' effect on task completion times. Overall, the task completion time significantly varied among the three airlines. Notably, 'gender', 'education level' and 'internet use frequency' had no significant effect on task completion times for both tasks. Re-design recommendations are provided for a sample of cases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
